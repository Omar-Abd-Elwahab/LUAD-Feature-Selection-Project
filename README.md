# LUAD-Feature-Selection-Project
This project works on identifying biomarkers for Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients, while building a classifier that can differentiate between LUAD patients from Normal patients. We propose a framework that applies an ensemble of feature selection techniques to identify genes highly correlated to LUAD. Utilizing LUAD RNA-seq data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we employed mutual information (MI) and recursive feature elimination (RFE) feature selection techniques along with support vector machine (SVM) classification model.
